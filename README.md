## Planned Future Additions
+ Working on adding more hololive characters
+ Compressing model sizes (currently mod is large and takes a few seconds to load)
+ Waiting on updates for [ModelReplacementAPI](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BunyaPineTree/ModelReplacementAPI/) for a better experience
+ Will work on fixes to get models to work in first-person mode
+ Adding jiggle bones in the future :)


## Notes / Known Issues
+ Mod requires [More Suits](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/x753/More_Suits/)
+ Mod will also remove original suits from More Suits to clear up space (Custom suits that uses More Suits will still work)
+ Not all freecams / Thirdperson mods are compatible with the ModelReplacementAPI, use [LCThirdPerson](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/xboxcontroller/LCThirdPerson/)
+ Clipping issues
